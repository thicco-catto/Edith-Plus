  character:AddItem(ItemID, RemoveCostume)
  
  ItemID is the item ID you want to add, you can use the CollectibleType Enum to make this easier (like shown in the example)
  
  RemoveCostume is if you want to remove that items' costume.
  Put true if you want to remove it.
  Put false or just don't include it if you want to keep the costume.
  
  If you do not want to add any items to this character, just remove all of these lines.

	--MORE INFO:--
	
	--Tear Color Info:--
	for tearcolor the first 4 numbers are the color of the base tear, and the last 3 numbers are for the "overlay" tear color
	default value is (1,1,1,1,0,0,0)

	color is R,G,B,A,R0,G0,B0
	Red
	Green
	Blue
	Alpha (Transparency)
	Red offset
	Green offset
	Blue Offset

	The first four numbers are normalized between 0 and 1, basically to get a normalized RGB value take the RGB value from 0-255 and divide by 255. thats the normalized number.
	
	Offset values are input directly as 0-255 instead of being normalized.
	
	--Item Info:--
	For vanilla items, here are links to vanilla Enumerators:

	Isaac.GetPillEffectByName("CUSTOMPILL")
	Isaac.GetCardIdByName("cardHudName")
	Isaac.GetTrinketIdByName("trinketName")
